ATLFoodFinder is a web app that allows users to search for restaurants using their location and several sorting fields. Users can sort by ratings, price, distance, cuisine type, and by name. 

On the home page, there are 3 randomized featured restaurants that users can view, with a button to allow users to access the searching map feature.

In order to use the searching feature, users need to first register an account using an email and password. Once logged in, users can add restaurants to their favorites page, allowing them to see the restaurant including reviews (adding and looking) in more detail by clicking on the view on Google Maps button. 

Users can also reset their password if the forget by inputting the email associated with their account. This sends an email through the terminal with a link to reset the password. Users can also access their profile page once logged in, where they can view their username and change their username/password.
